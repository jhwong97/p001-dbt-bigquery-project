- To create a complete ELT data pipeline using Airflow to perform data analysis work.
- To utilise Astro CLI in setting up the Airflow local environment.
- To perform data quality check on data extraction and transformation parts via SODA.
- To integrate dbt into the data pipeline as to automate the data transformation and loading it into data warehouse.
- To upload data to GCS and ingesting the data into BigQuery table using the Astro SDK.
